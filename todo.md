## To do

*   Add category classes to remove the need for many module prefixes and to share definitions of derived categorical operations.
    At some point, try using agda-categories.

*   Maybe parametrize machines by the stream functions they implement.
*   Consider making machines universe-level-polymorphic (easy).

## Did

*   Examples.
*   Module with list function semantics.
*   State & prove properties, including how `run` relates machine combinators to stream function combinators.
