This Agda project plays with composable Mealy machines with compositional/functorial semantics to generate computational hardware.

*   "`make compile`" to compile the test program, though faster from within the IDE (`∁-c C­x C-C`).
*   "`make figures`" to generate circuit diagrams in the `figures` subdirectory.
