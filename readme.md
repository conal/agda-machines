This Agda project plays with composable Mealy machines with compositional/functorial semantics.

The module `VecFun` is a semantic model, and `Mealy` is an operational model with a semantic function mapping to meanings in `VecFun`. That semantic function is shown to be a cartesian functor.


## To do

*   Semantics (interpreter) for netlists.
    Category instance and cartesian functor proof.
*   Try using agda-categories.
