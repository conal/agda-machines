This Agda project plays with composable Mealy machines with compositional/functorial semantics to generate computational hardware.

"`make compile`" to compile the test program.
"`make figures`" to generate circuit diagrams in the `figures` subdirectory.

## To do

*   Add category classes to remove the need for many module prefixes and to share definitions of derived categorical operations.
*   Try using agda-categories.
